# Using Material-UI

[Installation Docs](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/)

```
npm install @material-ui/core
```

**IMPORTANT**

> Note: The latest version of React has added hooks to their functional components so most of the material-ui documentation (as of version 3) demos their components and custom styling using functional components. You may choose to use functional components so that it's easier to copy what they are doing but everything they are showing you can be done with class based components. [Here](https://codesandbox.io/s/hopeful-newton-wzfqw) is an example with one of their functional component examples written in a class based version [https://codesandbox.io/s/hopeful-newton-wzfqw](https://codesandbox.io/s/hopeful-newton-wzfqw).
